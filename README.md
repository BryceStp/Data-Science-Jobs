# Notes:
1. The data set consists of scraped data from glassdoor on data science jobs.
2. A large portion of the data is categorical.
3. Not every job has a data science title. There are some data analysts, data engineers and a few other outliers. 
4. We build a shiny web app to display our findings and make it easier to navigate the data.
